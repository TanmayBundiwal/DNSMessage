# DNSMessage

DNSMessage is a Java-based DNS resolver that crafts DNS queries in hexadecimal and communicates with DNS servers to retrieve IP addresses of specified domains. This Internet computing project focuses on low-level network operations and protocol handling.

## Description

DNSMessage allows for direct interaction with DNS servers using hexadecimal-formatted queries, providing a hands-on experience with the DNS protocol. Ideal for educational purposes and network protocol exploration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Basic understanding of DNS protocols and Java programming

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Running the Project

Run the project using the Makefile:

```bash
make run
```

This command compiles the Java source files and executes the DNSMessage application.

## Usage

Use DNSMessage to craft and send DNS queries in hexadecimal format. The application will process these queries, interact with a DNS server, and return the corresponding IP address of the requested domain.
